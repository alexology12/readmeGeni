# Java-Quiz


## Inspiration 

I wanted to code something fun to make learning more enjoyable

## Description

There are a total of 5 multiple choice questions on basic concepts of javascript. Initially, the user must enter his/her name. The first question is shown on the screen, and the timer starts simultaneously on the side. The user has only 1 minute (60 seconds) to answer the questions. For every wrong answer, 15 seconds are reduced from the timer. If the user is not able to complete answering the questions within the time allotted, it is Game Over. High scores will be displayed on the screen and the user can store his/her scores.
